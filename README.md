Abstract:

The Hostel Management website serves as a comprehensive platform for 
accessing essential information related to the hostel, including details about 
accommodations, fee structures, available facilities, and contact information. 
The primary objective is to provide a user-friendly interface for students to apply 
for hostel admission by submitting online forms, with all applicant details 
securely stored in the backend. This data repository allows hostel faculty to 
efficiently manage student information for subsequent administrative tasks. 
Furthermore, the website facilitates student feedback, contributing to ongoing 
quality improvements in hostel services. The website streamlines access to 
hostel-related information, simplifies the admission process, and enhances 
overall service quality through valuable user input.
